        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Idly is a staple breakfast in many South Indian households, known for its soft, spongy texture and subtle flavor. What makes idly unique is its simplicity and versatility as a dish. It is naturally gluten-free, light on the stomach, and provides a balanced combination of carbohydrates and proteins, making it an ideal choice for a healthy meal. Traditionally, idly is served with an array of side dishes like chutneys and sambar, which enhances its flavor profile and offers a well-rounded culinary experience. The fermentation process used in making idlies not only improves digestion but also increases the bioavailability of nutrients, making it both delicious and nutritious.</p>
        <p>Idly's popularity has transcended regional boundaries, and it is now enjoyed across the country and even globally. Whether eaten plain or with flavorful accompaniments, idly is loved for its ability to absorb the tastes of the side dishes it's paired with. In addition to being a breakfast staple, idly is also commonly served as a light dinner or snack. Its versatility extends to modern adaptations, where people experiment by adding ingredients like millet, oats, or quinoa to the traditional recipe, giving this timeless dish a contemporary twist.</p>
